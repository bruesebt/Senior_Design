# Major Constraints

## Ethical Constraint

Since our app will be recommending our users to visit a particular business or venue, our app will impact members of the usersâ€™ local community. A constraint we need to consider in the context of ethics is eliminating bias in the recommendations our app presents. Our app should not recommend one chicken restaurant over another, or recommend larger/more well-known businesses instead of a newer and less well-known business. We need to make sure any APIs we use are also unbiased (like Google Maps), or at least account for the bias in the APIs we use.  Another way to ensure our application is ethical is by adding an age input. For example, if the app is being used by a ten year-old, our app will not recommend that they grab a pint from a nearby bar. 


## Time

For our project, we will have to be cognizant of time. Our app has a few milestones that we will work toward that each have their own time complexity. Firstly, we need to create a mobile application that interfaces well for the user. Next, we need to create code that analyzes the users input. Finally, we will use Google's Maps API to output places for the user to go. Having this timeline will help us to stay on track to finish the project by the end of the school year. 


## Professional and Technical Constraints

This project requires technical expertise in the following areas: Database design, API development, and mobile application  deployment. The development team is familiar with database design and API development and will not need much time to research best practices and best frameworks.  However, the team is not experienced in mobile application development and deployment.  This lack of expertise causes a delay in completion for the solution and will thus increase the timeline for the solution.  This is because the time to develop will increase as roadblocks will take longer to resolve.  It will also add a chunk of time for research on the process, frameworks, best practices, etc.  It will also take add the time of time figuring out how to deploy the application remotely as well as deal with app store requirements.

## Social Constraint
This project could be used by anyone in the public, and it is intended to enhance quality of social lives. The application will suggest activity ideas for people to do at any given time, and so it could influence the way that people use their time and money. This could benefit society by raising awareness of local businesses, parks, and restaurants. It could also benefit society by equipping people with a tool to enhance their social lives, which could boost happiness of the public in general. Something to be aware of when working on this project will be determining a way to measure user happiness as a result of the application's use. Finding a way to measure this could affect how the application suggests activities for a given user. The benefit of this project is that it will help people answer the common question: "What should we do tonight?", or "What's the move?"
