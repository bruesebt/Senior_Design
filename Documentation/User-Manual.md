###### Editing User Profile Settings
“What’s The Move?” will utilize information inside a created user profile.  These settings will help decide common settings across all preferences when influencing what activities to show.  After logging in you will be asked to set these global preferences, these include but are not limited to:
 - Age (for activities with age restrictions)
 - Location
 - In general properties that are not like likely to change

To edit these options, simply click on the user profile icon.  This will bring up your profile, and pressing the “preferences” tab will show your global preferences and selecting the edit icon will allow you to edit, add, remove user preferences.

###### Setting Preferences
When asking “What’s The Move?” to give activities, you will be asked to set preferences.  This will allow the app to curate the best activities based on these preferences.  These preferences include options such as:
 - Number of Participants
 - Dining Included
 - Leisurely
 - Dress Code
 - Budget 
 - Max Distance
 - Time Frame  

All of these will help decide which activity is best for you and your group, and the flexibility of these allows you to change them at your discretion if you do not have interest in any of the suggested activities.  If you create a set of preferences that you believe will be used frequently you will have the option to save, name, and use them later.

###### Seeing Saved/Previous Preferences
Saved preferences will be stored under the “saved preferences” tab in the menu.  This will allow you to go through and see all the preferences you decided to keep.  You can then go in and edit these as you choose; however, these changes are final and multiple versions are not saved, so change at your own discretion.  You can also add a new preference set by selecting the “add preference set” button.  To use these saved preferences when looking for activities, simply select “use saved preference” and choose the desired one instead of filling out preferences when asking “what’s the move” to give activities.

###### Home Interaction
The Home screen will be the users starting point once they have used the app and set up their user profile. The home screen will include:
 - “What’s The Move?” button to direct user to Preferences page
 - “Saved Preferences” Tab
 - “History” Tab
 - Previous Activities Tab

###### Performing a Search
On the home page, there will be a button to ask the question: “What’s the move?”. The user will be redirected to the Preferences page. This page will allow the user to set a new set of preferences, or use an old set of preferences to perform the activity search.

Once the user has set their preferences, there will be a button for the user to click to “Search” for activities to do that fit the preferences set by the user. Upon clicking this button, the user will be taken to a new page with a list of results. These results will be ranked based on how relevant the result is to the preferences taken as input, with the most compelling and relevant results listed at the top of the page. Each result will have information such as location, operating hours, pictures, reviews, link to establishment website, and other information to further help the user decide if this activity is right for them.

###### Interacting With Results
The user will have the ability to scroll through the list of activities the application has returned. If the user is dissatisfied with the results, they will have the ability to “Return to Preferences” to alter, say, how far they are willing to drive. 

Once the user has found a satisfactory activity, they can select the option by clicking on it. A prompt will appear asking the user: “Is this the move?” where they have the option to select Yes or No. Selecting “Yes” tells “What’s the Move” that the user has made a decision, and the application will save the choice to the “Previous Activities” section located on the home screen. Then the user will be redirected to the home screen.
