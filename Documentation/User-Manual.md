###### Performing a Search
On the home page, there will be a button to ask the question: “What’s the move?”. The user will be redirected to the Preferences page. This page will allow the user to set a new set of preferences, or use an old set of preferences to perform the activity search.

Once the user has set their preferences, there will be a button for the user to click to “Search” for activities to do that fit the preferences set by the user. Upon clicking this button, the user will be taken to a new page with a list of results. These results will be ranked based on how relevant the result is to the preferences taken as input, with the most compelling and relevant results listed at the top of the page. Each result will have information such as location, operating hours, pictures, reviews, link to establishment website, and other information to further help the user decide if this activity is right for them.

###### Interacting With Results

Once the user has found a satisfactory activity, they can select the option by clicking on it. A prompt will appear asking the user: “Is this the move?” where they have the option to select Yes or No. Selecting “Yes” tells “What’s the Move” that the user has made a decision, and the application will save the choice to the “Previous Activities” section located on the home screen. Then the user will be redirected to the home screen. The user can favorite and activity by swiping to the left on the specific activity.
