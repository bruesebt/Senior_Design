Capstone Assessment

CS5001 – Senior Design

The Senior Design courses and associated project are an opportunity to showcase the knowledge I have gained throughout my time at the University of Cincinnati. There are elements of my education that simply cannot be captured in a resume or even a brief interview. I want to take the opportunity during my final year to truly display what I know and apply my knowledge in a way that interests me and my teammates. Not only is the project an opportunity to show and apply my knowledge, but also an opportunity to explore beyond where my education has taken me thus far.

Out of the various computer science courses I have taken thus far, a few will help guide the development of our project. Below shows courses I have taken and how they will assist in the creation of our end deliverable:

*Practical Knowledge (language syntax, OOP concepts)
	*Python (CS2021)
	*Data Structures (CS2028C)
	*Programming Languages (CS3003)
	*Database Design (CS4092)
	*OS Programming (EECE4029)
*Producing Deliverables (communication skills, presenting)
	*Intermediate Comp (ENGL2089) 
	*Effective Speaking (COMM1071)
	*Technical Writing (ENGL4092)
	*Software Engineering (EECE3093C)

In order to truly showcase the knowledge gained in the classroom, our project must display excellence in the programming aspect as well as in its presentation and development process. Practical knowledge will be applied in the coding and creation of our final product (in our case, a mobile application). The communication learned, how to produce technical documents, and knowledge of the SDLC will all come into play in our timeline creation, team contract, and our final presentation.

Aside from the knowledge I have gained in the classroom, I have also learned plenty while on my co-op rotations. I have worked for one company, Cincinnati Insurance Co., but in many different roles. I have been a Desktop Support Technician, QA Tester, Release Engineer, and an IT Test Support Technician. While in support, I learned problem solving skills and how to create workaround solutions and think outside of the box. While in QA, I learned attention to detail and persistence. While working on releases, I learned more about software release cycles, builds, and code synchronization. Finally, as a test support tech, I created automated test cases and learned a lot about project organization, teamwork, and leadership. I expect to apply all this knowledge throughout the course of our project. When we hit roadblocks, I have the tools to think outside of the box and persist in finding a solution. I have the skills to organize our teamwork, as well as communicate clearly and professional. I can make meetings productive and effective. I have the skills to write meaningful and well-documented code.

I am excited to see where the project takes me and my teammates. We have decided to meet every Friday, and I have already seen our meetings progress in effectiveness, promptness, and clarity. I have not always felt close to my classmates – especially during COVID – and our preliminary meetings have already felt like a breath of fresh air. We spent extensive time during our meetings clearly defining a problem that we want to help solve: boredom. Without defining a clear problem, we cannot identify a clear solution. Further down the road, I will assess my success through the following questions:

*Does the application produce the desired output/does it work?
*Is our product helpful?
*Would I personally use our product?
*Did I thoroughly apply the knowledge I have gained in the classroom/co-op?
*Did I learn something new?
*Did I work well within my team/how was my collaboration?
*Did I communicate well/present well?

If I am able to answer &quot;Yes&quot; to the above questions, I will be satisfied in what I have accomplished in this project.
