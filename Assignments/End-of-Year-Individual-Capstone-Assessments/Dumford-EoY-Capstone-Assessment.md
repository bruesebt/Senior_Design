###### Self Assessment

For our project, I was originally in charge of the database. However, as we got
more into the implementation, there was more work to be done on the front end. I
primarily worked on the front end of our application. I contributed to the different views
and layouts of each view model.

We decided that the best front-end for our application was using Xameran. I had
never used this language before, so it was a great opportunity to learn something new
and expand my skills. I was successful in researching different controls and options to
implement our front end. It was fun to be creative and to focus on creating a clean,
appealing application. It was a challenge to code an entire application in a language that I
had never used before. This made the process slow at the start, but it became easier as
we developed more.
