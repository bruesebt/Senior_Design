###### Self Assessment
While working on this project, I took the role of architecting the solution and managing the project.
When setting up the project, we discussed at a high level how we wanted to set up the code, and then I
performed research to figure out best ways to architect the solution. This involved deciding what types
of frameworks to use and how everything would interact with one another. When it came to writing
code, I primarily wrote the back end of the solution – the web API and the database. I also laid out the
groundwork for the front-end, for my teammates to follow and execute on. Finally, I managed the
Kanban that we created for the project. I planned out tasks for the entire project, and then assigned
them to each team member as we went along with the project, to keep our team as focused as possible.

Throughout the year, I had to learn many new skills. Firstly, I learned communication skills. I found very
quickly that for our team to operate smoothly, as one unit, much communication would be needed. I
made it my aim to lead the team in sending out communications throughout the week. This included
initiating team meetings, sending out project updates as much as possible, and divvying out tasks – with
information on how to complete them. I also learned several technical skills throughout the year. I
learned how to create and deploy a database and web API. I also learned how to develop a mobile frontend, following MVVM architecture. I also learned how to manage a team, and how to bring a project
from start to finish. I feel that this is the major success of the year. I feel confident that I could manage a
project moving forward – whether my own or one in the workplace. I also feel motivated to work on my
own projects in the future. Some obstacles I faced include a lack of documentation and standard
operation procedures. Looking back, as I worked on the project, I wish that I would have documented
more along the way. I also wish that I would have written out standard operation procedures to follow –
like requiring Pull Requests for new features being added. This would have helped the whole team
understand and follow what each other team member was working on each week. Overall, I am happy
with my growth this year.
