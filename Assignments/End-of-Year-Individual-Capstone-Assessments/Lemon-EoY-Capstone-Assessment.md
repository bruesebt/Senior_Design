###### Self Assessment 
My contributions towards the project were mainly front-end work.  The frontend was a large facet of our application so it would make more sense to for me to focus on that.  The skills needed were very similar to the ones we thought would be needed in the initial assessment.  The skill of mobile development and front-end development was the main skill and was built upon as at the start I had never really worked with mobile.  To add to the frontend all that would be done is that I’d have to do stuff like add a button, add a new page, make a flow, etc.  This taught me a lot about how front-end frameworks work and how stuff like data flow between views works.  Overall, working with the front end greatly increased my skills as a developer.   

The successes for me were getting working views and having them operate as expected.  The front-end design and flow were very concise and easy to look at while still looking nice.  I am very happy with the end goal of the product and how well it felt.  The biggest obstacle was learning front-end development.  A lot of the technologies used were new to me and it took some time to understand what was happening and what the best way to implement it was.
