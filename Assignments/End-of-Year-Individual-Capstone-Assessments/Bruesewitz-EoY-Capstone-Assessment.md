###### Self Assessment
My individual contribution to the project was as a front-end developer, as well as
assisted in the design of each individual page and overall UI design. I worked alongside other
members of my team to accomplish the complete construction of the UI, but I personally
designed the home page and assembled the necessary code to navigate through the application
(e.g. moving from one page to the next). I leveraged C# in the code behind the pages to
navigate between page objects and used Xamarin to create the pages themselves.

I learned a lot through this process; I had not built a mobile application prior to this
project, and so I got a lot of opportunities to build upon my previous programming capabilities.
It felt hugely accomplishing to look at the finished product, and the final application felt like a
huge success. The roadblocks I faced were initially surrounding source control – making sure I
was pushing and pulling code frequently enough while collaborating with my teammates. I
haven’t had much experience in my co-op positions where four or more individuals are working
on the same pieces of code at the same time, so this was one challenge to overcome.
Additionally, I needed to learn Xamarin since I had not used it before.
