# Team: What's the Move?

## Project Topic Area
Our goal is to develop a mobile application that gives people the power to answer the question, "What's the move?"
Conceptually, the application asks a user for specific input about what preferences they have, and will output ideas of activities for them to do on a given day.
To begin with, the focus will be development of a mobile application that uses a simplified algorithm to determine outputs. 
Once the application is developed, there is an opportunity to include machine learning as well.
